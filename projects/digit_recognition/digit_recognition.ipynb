    "Design and implement a deep learning model that learns to recognize sequences of digits. Train the model using synthetic data generated by concatenating character images from [notMNIST](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html) or [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). To produce a synthetic sequence of digits for testing, you can for example limit yourself to sequences up to five digits, and use five classifiers on top of your deep network. You would have to incorporate an additional ‘blank’ character to account for shorter number sequences.\n",

    "There are various aspects to consider when thinking about this problem:\n",
    "- Your model can be derived from a deep neural net or a convolutional network.\n",
    "- You could experiment sharing or not the weights between the softmax classifiers.\n",
